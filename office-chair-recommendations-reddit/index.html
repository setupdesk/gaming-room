thoughts on the Ergolux Elliot Office Chair or Ergolux Everest From reddit.com
The main thing i liked about it was the lumbar support and how you can adjust the tension on it. I like the armrest adjustability (side, back, front, up/down movement) of secretlab and i like the lockable recliner feature as well. Though my height is a little taller and weight a little heavier. I&#39;m looking to buy a new chair as my current one isn&#39;t comfortable.
